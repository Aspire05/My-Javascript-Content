      <p>In <strong>JavaScript</strong>, reserved words are words that have a special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or labels) in your code. 
        These words are reserved because they are used by the language itself to define its syntax and functionality. 
        Using reserved words as identifiers will result in a syntax error.</p>
      <br>
      <p>1. <strong>Keywords:</strong> 
        are words that have a specific meaning in the JavaScript language.
        <br> 
        They are used to define the structure and logic of your code. 
        For example, if, else, while, for, function, return, switch, and typeof are keywords. 
        They play a crucial role in control flow, loops, function definition, and other fundamental programming constructs.</p>
        <br>
      <p>2. Reserved Words in<strong> ECMAScript 6 (ES6):</strong> 
        With the introduction of ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6 or ES2015), new keywords were added to the language to enhance its features. 
        <br>
        These include let, const, class, import, export, and more. 
        These keywords are reserved and have specific meanings in the context of ES6 features.</p>
        <br>
      <p>3. <strong>Literal Values:</strong>
        Certain words represent literal values in JavaScript and cannot be used as identifiers.
        <br> 
        Examples include true, false, null, and undefined. 
        These represent Boolean values, the absence of a value, and the undefined value, respectively.</p>
        <br>
      <p>4.<strong> Future Reserved Words:</strong>
        Some words are reserved for potential future use in JavaScript. 
        <br>
        While they might not have a specific meaning in the current version of the language, they are reserved to avoid conflicts with possible future features.</p>
        <br>
      <p>5.<strong> Strict Mode Reserved Words:</strong>
        Strict mode is a feature in JavaScript that helps catch common coding mistakes and prevents the use of certain error-prone features.
        <br>
        In strict mode, additional words like implements, interface, package, private, protected, public, and static are reserved.</p>
